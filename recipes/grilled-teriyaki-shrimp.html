    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These savory-sweet shrimp skewers are easy to make and cook in just a few minutes. They are perfect for summer
        weeknights or weekend dinner parties. Prep the sauce ahead of time for an even faster dinner. I prefer to use
        jumbo shrimp (21 to 25 per pound), however use what you have on hand.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh garlic</li>
        <li>1 pound jumbo shrimp</li>
        <li>1/2 fresh pineapple, cored and cut into 11/2 inch pieces</li>
        <li>skewers</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water, soy sauce, brown sugar, honey, garlic, and ginger in a small saucepan and bring to a boil
            over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce has reduced and thickened slightly,
            8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate. Thread shrimp and pineapple alternately
            onto skewers and place on a platter.</li>
        <li>Arrange skewers on the hot grate. Grill 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until shrimp is opaque and cooked
            through. Turn grill to low heat and brush sauce on both sides of skewers. Transfer to a serving platter and
            sprinkle with cilantro and sesame seeds.</li>
    </ol>
