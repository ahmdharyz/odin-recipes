    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) bottle Italian-style salad dressing</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk salad dressing, garlic powder, and salt together in a shallow baking dish; add chicken breasts and
            turn
            to coat. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess; discard remaining marinade.</li>
        <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 7 to
            8
            minutes on each side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees
            F (74 degrees C).</li>
